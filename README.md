# Codewars

This repository is for code I have written for the website Codewars
Codewars is a practice website that helps you build coding skills.

To me, this repository is intended to be a place I can store my code and revisit for certain syntax. 

The intention is to create branches for each "kyu" (that is difficulty - its from Karate). 8th kyu is the easiest

It is a work in progress :)
